# What is Docyard?

Docyard is a static site generator that turns Markdown files into documentation websites. You get search, dark mode, syntax highlighting, and components like callouts, tabs, and code groups - all without configuration.

## Who is it for?

Anyone who needs documentation - project docs, internal wikis, knowledge bases, or personal notes. If you prefer writing in Markdown over complex CMS tools, want documentation that's easy to maintain, and don't want to deal with setup overhead, Docyard is for you.

## What's included

- **For developers** - Hot reload, simple CLI, zero config to start
- **For your readers** - Full-text search, dark mode, responsive design, 10+ components
- **For production** - Static HTML, SEO meta tags, llms.txt for AI tools

## Requirements

Ruby {{ min_ruby }} or higher. That's the only dependency.
