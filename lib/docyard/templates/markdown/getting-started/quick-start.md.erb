# Quick Start

Get up and running with Docyard in under 5 minutes.

## 1. Install Docyard

```bash
gem install docyard
```

## 2. Initialize Your Project

Create a new documentation project:

```bash
docyard init
```


This creates a `docs/` folder with sample documentation files.

## 3. Start the Dev Server

```bash
docyard serve
```


Your documentation will be available at `http://localhost:4200`.

## 4. Edit Your Docs

Open `docs/index.md` and make some changes. The browser will automatically reload to show your changes.

## 5. Organize Your Content

Create folders to organize your documentation:

```bash
docs/
├── index.md
├── getting-started/
│   ├── introduction.md
│   └── installation.md
└── guides/
    ├── basic-usage.md
    └── advanced-features.md
```


The sidebar navigation will automatically reflect your folder structure.
