# File Structure

Understanding how Docyard organizes your documentation.

## Basic Structure

```bash
docs/
├── index.md              # Home page
├── getting-started/      # Section folder
│   ├── introduction.md
│   └── quick-start.md
└── guides/              # Another section
    └── tutorial.md
```

## Navigation Rules

- **Folders become sections** in the sidebar navigation
- **Files become pages** within those sections
- Files are sorted alphabetically
- `index.md` in the root is your home page

## File Naming

File names are automatically converted to page titles:

- `quick-start.md` → "Quick Start"
- `api-reference.md` → "Api Reference"
- `getting_started.md` → "Getting Started"

## Custom Titles

Override the auto-generated title using an H1 heading:

```markdown
# Custom Page Title

Your content here...
```

## Hidden Files

Files and folders starting with `_` or `.` are ignored:

- `_draft.md` - Not included
- `.notes.md` - Not included
- `published.md` - Included

## Nested Sections

You can nest folders to create sub-sections:

```bash
docs/
└── api/
    ├── classes/
    │   └── generator.md
    └── modules/
        └── utils.md
```
