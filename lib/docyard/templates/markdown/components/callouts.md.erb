# Callouts

Docyard supports beautiful callouts (also known as admonitions) to highlight important information in your documentation. Callouts support both VitePress-style syntax and GitHub-style alerts.

## Callout Types

There are 5 callout types, each with a distinct color and icon:

### Note (Blue)

Use **note** callouts for neutral, informational content that provides additional context.

::: note
This is a note callout with the default title.
:::

::: note Custom Title
You can customize the title of any callout type.
:::

### Tip (Green)

Use **tip** callouts for helpful advice, best practices, or pro tips.

::: tip
This is a helpful tip to improve your documentation.
:::

::: tip Best Practice
Always include callouts to make important information stand out!
:::

### Important (Purple)

Use **important** callouts for crucial information that requires special attention.

::: important
This information is important and should not be overlooked.
:::

::: important Critical Information
Pay special attention to this section of the documentation.
:::

### Warning (Orange)

Use **warning** callouts when users need to be careful or aware of potential issues.

::: warning
Be careful when following these instructions as they may affect your system.
:::

::: warning Potential Issues

:::

### Danger (Red)

Use **danger** callouts for critical warnings about dangerous operations or severe consequences.

::: danger
This operation is dangerous and may result in data loss. Proceed with extreme caution.
:::

::: danger Do Not Do This

:::

## GitHub-Style Alerts

Docyard also supports GitHub-style alert syntax for compatibility with existing documentation.

> [!NOTE]
> This is a GitHub-style note alert. It renders exactly the same as the VitePress syntax.

> [!TIP]
> GitHub alerts are automatically converted to beautifully styled callouts!

> [!IMPORTANT]
> You can use either syntax - both produce the same visual result.

> [!WARNING]
> GitHub-style warnings work just like VitePress warnings.

> [!CAUTION]
> The CAUTION type maps to the danger callout style.

## Rich Content Support

Callouts support all markdown features, making them extremely versatile.

### Inline Formatting

::: note
Callouts support **bold text**, *italic text*, `inline code`, and [links](https://github.com).
:::

### Lists

::: tip Key Features
Here are the main benefits of using callouts:

- Improved readability
- Visual hierarchy
- Better user engagement
- Accessible design with ARIA roles
- Dark mode support
:::

### Code Blocks

::: important
You can include code examples inside callouts:

```ruby
class Docyard::CalloutProcessor
  def self.preprocess(markdown)
    # Process callout syntax
  end
end
```

The code will be syntax-highlighted just like regular code blocks.
:::

### Multi-Paragraph Content

::: warning
This callout contains multiple paragraphs to demonstrate complex content.

Each paragraph is properly spaced and rendered. You can include as much content as you need.

You can even mix paragraphs with other elements like lists or code blocks.
:::

### Nested Content

::: tip Advanced Usage
Callouts can contain complex nested structures:

1. **First step**: Install Docyard
   ```bash
   gem install docyard
   ```

2. **Second step**: Initialize your project
   ```bash
   docyard init my-docs
   ```

3. **Third step**: Start the development server
   ```bash
   docyard serve
   ```

And you're ready to go!
:::

## Multiple Callouts

You can use multiple callouts in sequence to create rich, informative documentation:

::: note Prerequisites
Before starting this tutorial, make sure you have Ruby 3.0+ installed.
:::

::: tip
Use `ruby --version` to check your Ruby version.
:::

::: warning
If you're using a Ruby version older than 3.0, some features may not work correctly.
:::

## Accessibility

All callouts include proper ARIA roles for screen readers:

- Note, Tip, and Important callouts use `role="note"`
- Warning and Danger callouts use `role="alert"` for higher priority

## Dark Mode

Callouts automatically adapt to dark mode with enhanced colors and subtle glow effects for better visibility.
