# Security Policy

## Reporting a Vulnerability

If you discover a security vulnerability in Docyard, please report it by emailing the maintainer directly rather than opening a public issue.

**Do not disclose security vulnerabilities publicly until they have been addressed.**

When reporting, please include:

- Description of the vulnerability
- Steps to reproduce
- Potential impact
- Suggested fix (if any)

You can expect an initial response within 48 hours. We will work with you to understand and address the issue promptly.
